                                        Our customers love the mobile apps we had created by Enuke. Enuke took the time to understand our requirement fully and our industry to know how the apps need to perform, and we are thankful to Enuke
                                        for this. Our Restaurant POS system is a complex system, they made sure to understand it thorughly and came up with intuitive and easy to use mobile app, which works beautifully. Enuke created Android
                                        and Apple apps for us. We are really pleased and will recommend Enuke to anyone looking to get apps built for their enterprise business.

                                        I hired Manu and his team at Enuke to work on some web development work for Bottlenotes. They were among several contractors that we were testing out, and they quickly established themselves at the
                                        top of the pack. What impressed me most about them is that Iâ€™m able to give them fairly loose, high level instructions, and they look at the broader technical implications that as a non-technical
                                        person I may not have considered. In short, they think a step ahead.
